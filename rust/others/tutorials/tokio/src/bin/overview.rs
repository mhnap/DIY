    // Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language.
    // It provides the building blocks needed for writing networking
    // applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of
    // systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded
    // devices.

    // At a high level, Tokio provides a few major components:
    // - A multi-threaded runtime for executing asynchronous code.
    // - An asynchronous version of the standard library.
    // - A large ecosystem of libraries.
